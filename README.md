# Building Build Detstroy Animations

This repository contains scripts, which allows to model building construction and destruction animation. Only one model is needed. Model becomes modular on runtime and each chunk is found from linked groups of vertices (i.e. in Blender similar vertices selection operation could be done by using Ctrl+L). Build and destruction animations can be written into mesh files for later use in game.

Simply click play button in the Main scene in order to run the demo.
