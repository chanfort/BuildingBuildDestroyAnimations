This file will highlight what is being used from 3rd parties as well as links to relevant projects:

1. KDTree class (http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/29923-Point-nearest-neighbour-search-class) is used for fast searches of vertex neighbours inside the mesh.

2. HeapSort algorithm inside `BuildDestroyAnimationManager.cs` is based on this tutorial https://begeeben.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/heap-sort-in-c/ .

3. The House model was modeled with Blender and exported as FBX file.

4. All my other code can be used under MIT License and included House model under CC0 License.
